# Destroying Objects GarbageCollection
# Python deletes unneeded objects built âˆ’ intypesorclassinstances automatically to free the memory space.
# The process by which Python periodically reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is
# termed Garbage Collection.
# Python's garbage collector runs during program execution and is triggered when an object's
# reference count reaches zero. An object's reference count changes as the number of aliases that
# point to it changes.
# An object's reference count increases when it is assigned a new name or placed in a container
# list, tuple, or dictionary. The object's reference count decreases when it's deleted with del, its reference
# is reassigned, or its reference goes  out of scope. When an object's reference count reaches zero,
# Python collects it automatically.

        print ("destroyed {} of {}".format(object, className))
