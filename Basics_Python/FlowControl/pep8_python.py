# what is pep 8 and why you need pep 8 
# Beautiful is better than ugly.
# Explicit is better than implicit.
# Simple is better than complex.
# Complex is better than complicated.
# Flat is better than nested.
# Sparse is better than dense.
# Readability counts.
# Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
# Although practicality beats purity.
# Errors should never pass silently.
# Unless explicitly silenced.
# In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
# There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
# Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
# Now is better than never.
# Although never is often better than *right* now.
# If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
# If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
# Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
# naming convention
# function in lower case
# example function def my_function()
# my_variable = 'two'
# package name should not have underscore
# single letter variable name ok for arithmetic
# like x = 'John'
# first_name, last_name = name.split()

# Code layout

# Class  and function separate with blanc lines

#class MyClas():
##    pass
##    def first_method(self):
##        pass
##    def second_method(self):
##        pass
## pep 8 tells you should have not more than 79 characters
## in a line  
##  you can continue with implied contnuation
## as below def funtion(arg_one, arg_two,
#                       arg_three, arg_four)
# return arg_one
# if you break line code hould follow  the same line
# for binary  break before operator
# total = (first_variable 
#           + second_variable
#           + third_variable)
# if (x >3 and
#         x< 10):
#     print(x)
# list_of_number = [
#      1,2,3,
#      4,2,3,
#      7,8,9]
