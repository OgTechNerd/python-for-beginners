# NumPy is the fundamental Python package for scientific computing. It adds the capabilities  of N-dimensional arrays, element-by-element operations (broadcasting), core
# mathematical operations like linear algebra, and the ability to wrap C/C++/Fortran  code.We will cover most of these aspects in this chapter by first covering

# The NumPy package enables users to overcome the shortcomings of the Python lists by providing a data storage object called ndarray. The ndarray is similar to lists,
# but rather than being highly flexible by storing different types of objects in one list, only the same type of element can be stored in each column. For example,
# with a Python list, you could make the first element a list and the second another list or dictionary. With NumPy arrays, you can only store the same type of
# element, e.g., all elements must be floats, integers, or strings. Despite this limitation, ndarray wins hands down when it comes to operation times, as the 
# operations are sped up significantly. Using the time's magic command in IPython, we compare the power of NumPy ndarray versus Python lists in terms of speed.
#!/usr/bin/Python3
import numpy as np

#array1 = np.arange(1e7)
#array2 = array1.tolist()
#print(array1, array2)

arr1 = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
arr2 = [[0,1,2],[4,5,6]]

# The ndarray operation is âˆ¼ 25 faster than the Python loop in this example. Are you convinced that the NumPy ndarray is the way to go? From this point on, we will be
# working with the array objects instead of lists when possible. Should we need linear algebra operations, we can use the matrix object, which does not
# use the default broadcast operation from ndarray. For example, when youmultiply two equally sized ndarrays, which we will denote as A and B, the ni, j element of A is only
# multiplied by the ni, j element of B. When multiplying

arr4 = np.zeros((2,2))
matrix_arr = np.matrix(arr4)

arr3 = np.arange(1000)

# Matrix Multiplication 

arr5 = np.arange(100).reshape(10, 10)
arr6 = np.arange(200).reshape(10, 20)
result = arr5.dot(arr6)
# creating 5x5x5 cube of 1's
cube_array = np.ones((5,5,5)).astype(np.float16)
print("{} \n {} \n {} \n  {} \n {}".format(arr1, arr2, cube_array, matrix_arr, result))
print(" shape : {0} dimension: {1} type: {2} itemsize: {3}".format(arr1.shape, arr1.ndim, arr1.dtype, arr1.itemsize ))
